"Happy Birthday! 🎉

I honestly can’t believe how much things have changed between us over the past two years. We started off not being that close, but I’m really happy about how much more comfortable we’ve become with each other now. You’ve always had this calm, disciplined, and focused vibe and I genuinely admire the way you’re chasing your army dreams with so much passion and dedication.

I also really want to thank you for always being there for me on every one of my birthdays these past two years, even when you were super busy. It might seem like a small thing, but it means a lot to me. You made me feel like I actually matter in your life, and I’ll always remember that.

I truly wish you all the strength, courage, and luck in the world for everything you’re working toward. I know you’ll achieve great things because your determination honestly inspires people around you including me.

And I hope, even as life changes and you have someone special by your side now (I know I can’t expect much), you’ll still feel okay sharing things with me sometimes. I’ll always be here to listen, to care, and to cheer for you.

So once again, happy birthday. I hope your day is filled with peace, laughter, and people who make you feel loved just like you make others feel."
