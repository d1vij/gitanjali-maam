A very Happy B'day.
Dearest Aysuh, (missed you today in the 3rd Period, for Green Skills)
A very happy 18th Birthday. Now you dont are rather are not answerable to parents but to the Government. (ʘ‿ʘ)

Welcome to adulthood - You are officially an adult, but for us you will always be this young, bright and kind hearted boy. Welcome to the age of more freedom, more fun and slightly more responsibility.
Seeing you past these 3 years, You are just a brain of Einstein with a great potential and extremely soft and polite at heart.
I am sure that you are going to do wonders in future (just keep me informed). Waiting to see your articles in magazines & news paper.
Very Very fond of you and will miss you in the coming years in school. It has been a pleasure to know you. All my blesssings and loads & loads of love.
Gitanjali Maam !!
