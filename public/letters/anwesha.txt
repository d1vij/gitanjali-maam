I have known you all my life. You've been the annoying older brother since Day 1 now that I look back I dont think I'd be able to live without you, ever. Remember the times we'd play stupid games and you'd always bully me into following your way?
Those little games eventually turned into late night talks - whether that be deep conversations or just complaining about teachers. The times we've gone out to eat, where I had promised I'd pay but ended up tricking you into paying and never returning the money. 
Sure, I've been angry at you multiple times in fifteen years (to be fair, you gave so many reasons to be mad) and you’ve been angry at me too but neither of us could stay like that too long, like opposites of a magnet always being attracted to eachother. Our personalities, our interests, our everything is polar opposite but that's what makes this relationship special. Every moment I spend with you makes me grateful for you - doesn't matter if it's us watching a movie or fighting. 

The last few months, have made me scared. Scared what I'll do without you being here. When you're off to college. But remember wherever you are, we're always together, joined in our hearts with a connection only we posess.

To my brother who has always protected me.
