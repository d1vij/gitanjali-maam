                    Thank you @Gitanjali Mody Ip for taking so much extra
                    efforts to make us learn IP. I'll also remember those late
                    night Google meets where we used to learn effectively and
                    created good memories as well. I've never seen a teacher who
                    takes so much effort to make the student confident in
                    his/her subject. Will always remember the "green skills"
                    which we played. Please never forget the "someone" who
                    answered your question in Google meet. We all will make you
                    proud in our board exams ✨✨🥳🥳🥹

                    their students performs well….And the fact that

                    @Gitanjali Mody Ip Ma’am first of all i would like to
                    sincerely thank you for providing ur efforts into teaching
                    us ip not just for exams but for life .....your guidance has
                    truly made a difference for all of us not just academically
                    but in general......for me you have been one of the most
                    approachable and caring teachers, right after my class 7
                    class teacher Mana ma’am.....i have never ever seen this in
                    my 10 years being in Dav that any teacher went out of their
                    way to take extra online lectures for us as you did... and i
                    will never forget the memories that were created through
                    those.....it really showed how deeply you cared to make our
                    lives easier....i thank you from the bottom of my heart for
                    your patience, support, and constant encouragement over
                    these two memorable years....I will always be grateful for
                    everything you have taught us.
