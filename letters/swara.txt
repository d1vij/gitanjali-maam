Hey Ayush, happy 18th! ✨
Now that ur officially an adult, I just hope u keep chasing whatever u believe in , no matter how big or crazy it seems. You’ve got the brains, patience, discipline, and that dream of serving the country...and I know you’ll make it happen someday...
Can’t believe it’s already been two years of knowing you.. from random talks to serious convos, it’s been such a fun and inspiring journey having u around. You are one of those people who inspires me quietly, not by showing off, but just by being 'you' (smart, disciplined, and genuinely kind). I’m always amazed by ur endless curiosity and dedication towards science, it’s honestly so inspiring to see how much it means to you. Keep being the grounded, kind, and determined person u are and never stop aiming higher. Stay the same humble, passionate, and 'quietly confident' Ayush u hv always been that’s what makes u stand out.
You have everything it takes to do great things, and I hope u never forget that.
So here’s to ur dreams, ur upcoming journey, and the amazing person you’re becoming.
Happy 18th once again!!
