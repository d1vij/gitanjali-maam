Dear Ayush!!!
I remember a shy boy sitting on last benches, hardly answering questions.
Then post exam got to know about Ayush's interest (extreme) in science and chemistry.
It is indeed pleasure to have a student like you to teach, to discuss the subject with. You are a humble, noble and kind soul with a lot of potential.
Be more Confident, vocal, work hard and chase you dreams.
Happy 18th birthday.
You arre really really one of the most loved student of mine iykuk.
Scribbing this coz of short notice.
once again Happy birthday. Keep in touch.... loads of love
